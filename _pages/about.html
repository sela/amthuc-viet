        <h2>The story of Amthuc Viet</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8 pr-5">
            <p>Our family is a new member of the beautiful Wadhurst community in East Sussex. I am Vietnamese, growing up in the
                South of Vietnam. When I moved to London four years ago, I missed my homeland and all the flavours of Vietnamese cuisine.</p>
    
            <p>I started to discover shops that sell Vietnamese products in London and cook all my favourite dishes for my family. I was so
                happy to have all my familiar aromas again and have all the authentic food available in my home.</p>
    
            <p>I started to cook more of a variety of dishes for my family and friends and felt so good when they enjoyed it. Some of my
                friends suggested "If you like so much to cook, why don't you start a food business?"</p>

            <p>With great motivation from my partner and the cooking inspiration, I started Amthuc Viet. I would love to bring you the
                special flavours of every single dish, which is carefully prepared from fresh ingredients cooked with passion.</p>
