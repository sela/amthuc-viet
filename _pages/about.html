        <h2><span>The story of Amthuc Viet</span></h2>

    </div>

    <div class="row listrecent">
        <p>Our family is a new member of the beautiful Wadhurst community in East Sussex. I am Vietnamese, grew up in the South
        of Vietnam. When I moved to London four years ago, I missed so much my homeland, and all the flavours of
        Vietnamese food. I started to find out shops that sell Vietnamese stuff in London, cook all my favourite dishes
        for my family. I was very happy having smelling all familiar flavours, see all the authentic meals available in
        my home, and the most important is my husband really enjoy what I made. He loves Vietnamese food too.</p>

        <p>I started to cook more and more different dishes for my family and friends, and feel so good when they enjoy what
        I made. Some of my friends suggested "If you like so much to make food, why don't you start a food business?"</p>

        <p>With great motivation from my husband, and the cooking inspiration. We have registration for Vietnamese takeaway
        at out new home in Wadhurst. I would love to bring you the special flavour of every single dishes, which is careful
        prepared from fresh ingredient and be cooked with my passion.</p>

        <p>Most of materials are from local suppliers. To offer you the freshest food, we suggest to make your order at
            least a day in advance.</p>
