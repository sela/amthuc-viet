            <p>As a recent addition to the charming Wadhurst community in East Sussex, my family and I are thrilled to share our love for Vietnamese cuisine. Having grown up in the southern region of Vietnam, I have always missed the authentic flavours of my homeland, especially since moving to England in 2016.</p>
            <p>To satisfy my cravings, I began to explore local shops that sold Vietnamese products and started cooking my favourite dishes at home for my family. It was delightful to have familiar aromas and authentic food readily available to me.</p>
            <p>As I experimented with various dishes, my family and friends thoroughly enjoyed them, and some even suggested starting a food business. With my partner's encouragement and my passion for cooking, I founded AmthucViet.</p>
