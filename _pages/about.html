        <h2>The story of Amthuc Viet</h2>

    <div class="row">

            <p>Our family is a new member of the beautiful Wadhurst community in East Sussex. I am Vietnamese, grew up in the South
            of Vietnam. When I moved to London four years ago, I missed so much my homeland and all the flavours of
            Vietnamese food. I started to find out shops that sell Vietnamese stuff in London, cook all my favourite dishes
            for my family. I was very happy having to smell again all my familiar smells, and have all the authentic food available in
            my home, and the most important is my husband really enjoyed what I made.</p>
    
            <p>I started to cook more and more different dishes for my family and friends, and felt so good when they enjoyed it.
                Some of my friends suggested "If you like so much to make food, why don't you start a food business?"</p>
    
            <p>With a great motivation from my husband and the cooking inspiration. I would love to bring you the special flavour
                of every single dishes, which is careful prepared from fresh ingredient and be cooked with my passion.</p>
    
            <p>We source most of the ingredients from local suppliers.</p>
